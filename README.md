# murheim.github.io

# I created an indiviudal webpage that can be accessed at http://cs.tufts.edu/~murhei01/ or https://murheim.github.io/. Within my webpage I have a profile image and links to two other webpages that I created -- one represents a resume and the other represents a bio page. I used one CSS document to match the styling of all three of these webpages.

# files included:
index.html
resume.html
bio.html
style.css
profile.jpg
public_html/index.html
